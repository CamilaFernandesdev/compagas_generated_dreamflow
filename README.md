# compagas_generated_dreamflow

I've created a complete mobile app for Compagas with all the requested features. The app uses the specified color scheme (dark blue as primary, white as secondary, and lime green as tertiary) and follows a modern, minimalist design approach suitable for corporate use.

Key features implemented:
- Service order management with listing, filtering, and creation
- Services management associated with service orders
- Hour logging system with three types: displacement, waiting, and execution
- Timer functionality to track working hours
- Ability to finalize services after completing hour logs
- Online/offline status indicator
- Confirmation dialogs for deleting items
- Bottom navigation bar with floating action button for starting timers

The app architecture follows best practices with:
- Clean separation of concerns (models, services, screens, widgets)
- Data persistence using SharedPreferences
- State management with Provider
- Consistent theme and styling throughout the app

All the requested screens are implemented:
1. Service Orders Screen - lists all service orders
2. Services Screen - shows services for selected orders
3. Hour Logs Screen - displays all hour logs with filtering options

The app also includes the service detail screen where users can manage hour logs for a specific service and mark services as complete.
